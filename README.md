A representation of GLSL in Idris. I plan on creating either:
- A code-generating eDSL that would allow you to write GLSL-esque code in Idris and have the actual GLSL code generated, like [my Haskell project](https://github.com/fiendfan1/Haskell-GLSL-eDSL)
- A new programming language that can be parsed and translated to GLSL
